# espresso_log

A new Flutter project.

## TODO
- speed-up connecting OR show progress
- check bloc usages (too many rebuilds?)
- settings screen
- save and history
- fix negative values being off a bit

bluetooth performance:
- add scan filter
- cache id (using shared prefs)
- try to connect, on failure scan

## Development
- install FVM
- run `fvm flutter pub get`
- run `fvm dart run tools/setup_git_hooks.dart`
